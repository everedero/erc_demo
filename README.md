# KiCAD ERC demos

Catastrophic schematics made to demonstrate why ERC exists, and how to use them.

Current KiCAD version used: V8

Also see exemple in: https://github.com/everedero/asynth2osc/tree/broken_erc

## KiCAD ERC saving the day

* Get to know them!

### Mainstream ERC: the ones people really use
* Unresolved text variables and "software" bugs
* Issues with libraries
* "No connect" and no connect indicator

### Misunderstood ERC: are they really useful?
* Grid: not respecting the grid is a big trap
* 4 connection points: can be legit but can also be a graphical trap
* Footprints and footprints filters

### Really misundesrstood ERC: the connection matrix
* Some external components do not have pin types set: check and repair components
